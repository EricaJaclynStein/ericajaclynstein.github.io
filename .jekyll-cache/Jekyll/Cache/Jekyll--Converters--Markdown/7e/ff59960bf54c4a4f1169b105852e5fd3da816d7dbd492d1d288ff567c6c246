<p><strong>This is the situation:</strong> sometimes life just gives you lots of poop and you find yourself just sitting there. Anecdotally, when I get stopped up and crampy, as I do on a pretty regular basis, this bit of something something reminds me that, no matter how painful it might be, I can always do something about it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. Thatâ€™s maybe the most important thing. Itâ€™s to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and youâ€™re just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.<br /><br />
I think thatâ€™s very important and however you learn that, once you learn it, youâ€™ll want to change life and make it better, cause itâ€™s kind of messed up, in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, youâ€™ll never be the same again.<br /><br />
Most people never pick up the phone, most people never ask. And thatâ€™s what separates, sometimes, the people that do things from the people that just dream about them. You gotta act. And you gotta be willing to failâ€¦ if youâ€™re afraid of failing, you wonâ€™t get very far.<br /><br />
â€“ Steve Jobs</p>
