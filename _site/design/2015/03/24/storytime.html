    <p>Today, I found myself partaking in a peculiar experience. I think I would call it a location-based mobile search use case - in the wild! </p>

<p>One that might likely be seen across a wide variety of populations. </p>

<p>When I was at the Doctor this morning, I was asked to fill out the typical clipboard-worthy hunk of paperwork. There I was, sitting with the clipboard in my lap, pen in my right hand, and iPhone in my left hand. </p>

<p>When I had completed all four sheets, I had a realization - I hadn&#39;t rememered a time before this when I had used my phone so heavily to fill out some basic information for a Doctor&#39;s office. </p>

<p>As I expanded that thought around my newly observed digital dependence, I immediately recognized this perplexing situation - it was quite simple to see. I understood in that moment that I wouldn&#39;t have been able to fill out a solid chunk, about 20%, of the requested information, without quickly pulling out my phone, opening up Safari, and searching for it! </p>

<p>For the sake of science, let&#39;s get specific about this â€“ I found myself looking up one or more of the following: my local Doctor&#39;s address and phone number, my local Pharmacy&#39;s address and phone number, an Insurance company&#39;s address and phone number.</p>

<p>Well, aside from the general behavioral insights, this confirmed it: I am highly dependent on Google when it comes to finding any sort of business-related contact information. </p>

<p>I wondered whether the 8 other people in the waiting room also rely on a quick mobile search for this kind of information when filling out Doctor office paperwork, or any paperwork for that matter. I decided it was likely so. I also decided against the temptuous adhoc field research opportunity because invading the waiting room ambiance just didn&#39;t seem like a smart idea at the time. </p>
