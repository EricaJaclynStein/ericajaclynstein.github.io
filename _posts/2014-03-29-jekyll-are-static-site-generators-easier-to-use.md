As a designer, it’s like a breath of fresh air to step on the other side of things for a second. It’s just too easy to get wrapped up in what you do from only one perspective. Needless to say, I needed a break from user-related things and colors and stuff so I looked more into Jekyll the other night. It looks like a super cool, "lean" way to manage and completely control a minimalistic blog site.

I absolutely love how simple it is to efficiently create content in markdown and commit to publish. I prefer this way of creating and editing content over having to go through an entire user-facing wyziwyg. So, after some research I found Prose.io and completely fell in love — its a clean and fast way to create and edit your site docs in browser. Coming from a UX designer, the UI is damn good for a “developer’s tool”.  
Trying to wrap my head around Jekyll and it’s components has not been easy though. It’s forced me to learn how to use the command line, install Ruby, and RubyGems — which was all pretty cool because my knowledge of coding consists only of self-taught objective oriented basics, html, and css.

I was able to set up Jekyll and stand up a horrendous/broken site in about 3 hours (hah) - I’m positive that the code is a complete mess but I’ll get to that later. Have a look and a giggle if you’d like http://ericajaclynstein.github.io/
Ending designer’s thought: Sketch app is to static site generator as photoshop is to Wordpress or Locomotive
