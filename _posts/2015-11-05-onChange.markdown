# On Change #

Change is fucking frightening. It's everything and it's nothing. Change makes a life worth living, and change makes a dream worth having and a fear worth putting up with. Oh, how fortunate are we to experience a so-called "life". 

And so, everything is an excuse. And honestly, dear God what is there ever to lose? We all will inevitably lose every last thing, every last person, every experience and experience to experience, and this life will cease to exist, and when that happens, oh will it happen, nothing is left. Nothing. No, these lives are not here breathing last breaths of morbid excuses, they are only here for one very simple reason: to exist. For when we kill our most sacred and yet unknown heart of hearts, and bury it long before our bodies are put into the ground, we choose to die. Choose to exist, choose to change. 

I think, I breathe, I change. These are three facts. We are this now, We were that before, and eventually, we will be all the same yet something else entirely. Is this scary? Born with purpose, but within a void. What keeps our hearts pounding in the moment, and at the end of the day, or the end of week, month, or year? What keeps our hearts wanting? Dreams, desire, fear; a promise of...

In change, there is loss.
