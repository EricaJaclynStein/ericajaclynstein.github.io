## Understanding Adaptive Design

This is not a write up of how to devise a strategy for responsive design, we already have that - it’s called Bootstrap (in a nutshell). Responsive design isn’t a content strategy and actually has very little to with content at all. 

You see, it’s critical at this point to develop device specific user interfaces. Multiple studies, like the last [“EyeTrack: Tablet Research”] from the Poynter Institute, show that user interactions and expectations differ according to device. We want to address these differences in usage by providing a user experience tailored to the specific device. 

Now, we couldn’t possibly do this with solely responsive design. To understand, let’s walk through the definitions of responsive and adaptive design and discuss the relationship between between the two.

### On Play-Doh and Adaptation

It hit me when I popped open a can of Play-doh. Play-Doh and web/mobile interaction design share some pretty deep qualities. I like to think of Play-doh as The Content and the Responsive Framework as the ingredients in the Play-doh, the ones that give it that memorable mushy-gushy form. It has just the right mixture to construct that ductile, moldable substance that you can play with for hours. You can literally do anything you want to with Play-doh, all depends on how you want to play with it. You can stretch it, tear it apart and put it back together, morph it into different shapes and stuff it into different containers, and you can even eat it. Just like a responsive framework and adaptive content, the relationship between the ingredients, the entity, and the “player of the Doh” is symbiotic – they all work to serve each other; likewise, so does a responsive framework, adaptive content, and a user. 

### Adaptive Design is Server-Side

It’s important to understand how content adaptation works –– adaptive design is server-side, which means the server detects and loads a template (or version) of the page that is optimized for the devices dimensions and features, all before the page is actually served to the user. Device specific functionality, features, and interactions are designed for and provided depending upon the content strategy and the message we need to get across. [Brett Atwood] has the right idea when he reminds designers:

> Content might be re-distributed and/or re-purposed in other channels of delivery. For 
> example, will it be easily indexed on search engines? Do we make it easy for people to 
> share it via social networks, such as Facebook? Would they even want to? Why or why
> not?
 
### The Output of Adaptive Design

The output of “adaptive design” is an adaptive content strategy, to put it simply. You see, the buzzword “adaptive” encompasses very little of what the term really means. As you can see, responsive design is a bit simpler and does not respond to the needs of a user. It’s solely technical, ensuring that content fits within a display – and while all of the page’s content remains the same, it’s often optional to hide pieces of information as screen display dimensions change, though, this is often not the best solution. Instead of retrofitting an existing desktop-only content strategy after the fact, we design each experience in and of itself. We think through well-known behavioral patterns, context-driven use cases, user mentalities, perspectives, and consider the information that will be displayed on the screen. Retrofitting requires more or less the continuous condensing and pruning of content from desktop, to tablet, to smaller devices. Designer, [Karen McGrane], sums it up quite nicely: “truncation is not a content strategy...”
