#The Secret to Becoming a Better Human Being: Sleep

###Sleep is the truest love of your life

In fact, it takes the lead on defining your life: your behavior, your mood, and your health.

But, sleep is tough. Sometimes it's amazing and welcome, and sometimes not desireable or convenient at all. If you truly believe that you can still maximize your productivity or value by sacrificing your sleep, you're not looking at the big picture.

##Good Habits, People

Sleep can help us decrease chaos, form good habits, and independently institute patterns of behavioral change.

The number one reason that is most undervalued and underestimated when it comes to sleep is the simple fact that it is a willfully controlled pattern of behavior to rest oneself. To digest and decrease the entropy of the day, relax, and slip into natural revitalization (per say). We are biologically wired to go into REM (rapid eye movement) sleep every night. Science suggests that our memory may be impaired when deprived of REM on a sporadic or regular basis. On a similar note, very recent research is suggesting that sleep deprivation quite literally stops your brain from cleansing itself of beta-amyloid toxins found in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.

Scientifically coming to the conclusion that sleep deprivation degrades the brain is not too surprising. But its not just maintenance of mental stability and functionality that sleeping enough provides, it’s the practice of self control and viewing the bigger picture. Sacrificing sleep to finish a project on time, or to work a little more may solve an immediate problem, but it’s often not paving a path towards a more productive future. You’re better off learning why you were up so late working and use your findings to then figure out how to save your sleep next time.

By instituting this one habit into your life you make it much easier for yourself to create and continue other beneficial habits. When we create and habitually perform behaviors that exhibit results, over a period of time we experience and feel the impact. We assess the cause and effect. Healthy behaviors that produce beneficial results eventually lead to huge positive impact. The more you can adapt, the more productive you will be.

When you’re tired and exhausted from a long night, or a long week you tend to concentrate on those feelings of exhaustion instead of getting other things done and accomplishing goals. The exhaustion we are feeling when sleep deprived leads us to be more hot tempered, annoyed, and lethargic. Our reaction time is decreased and we tend to follow through with negative through patterns. Though sleep is a very personal pattern of behavior, it greatly effects those around you and those you work with. Come the end of the week, you may wonder why you haven’t checked everything off your list that you had planned to complete. Your fatigue has caused you to drag out your time to completion on tasks. You may have other people waiting on you to do their jobs but your lack of motivation (and memory) has caused you to fall behind on deadlines. When this happens we often create a vicious cycle of negative emotions, feeling down, working late at night in attempt to remedy the situation, and repeating it all over again the next day. Long term sleep deprivation cuts down on positive outlook, amiability, interaction, and just all around good vibes.

##Stay Healthy and Stay Motivated

When you give your body enough sleep you help regulate your internal processes by balancing hormones such as cortisol and leptin. With constant low leptin levels from lack of sleep you are more likely to overeat, more likely to feel bloated, more likely to gain weight, and overall live an unhealthy lifestyle. Cortisol is also an appetite-stimulating hormone and, at high levels, is more likely to leave you anxious, stressed, and alert. Sleeping 6-8 hours and at around the same time each night is critical to maintaining a healthy balance of Cortisol. It is produced when sleeping and easily disrupted. Minor distractions at night such as light or noises from a device or TV can cause increase in cortisol production. It’s been proven (and it’s not hard to believe) that staring at screens during late hours is scientifically linked to sleep deprivation. Digital and electronic displays decrease melatonin and raises cortisol levels. Unfortunately, cortisol triggers are everywhere. Caffeine and stress are top offenders and are both way too easy to intake and require not-significant amounts of effort to reject. Not to mention, keeping your body and mind alert for long periods of time will cause increased production of Cortisol and again, we can create a vicious cycle of sleep deprivation for ourselves. With an optimal metabolism, regulated blood pressure, and a highly functional immune system we are likely to be happier, get sick less, and be more productive and motivated.

For those of you in the tech industry like myself, I’ll leave you with a simple tip for getting to bed earlier tonight: step away from the technology. Power off and put down. If you know how to balance your sleep schedule, you will know how to balance your day schedule and there will be plenty of time for that screen tomorrow.
