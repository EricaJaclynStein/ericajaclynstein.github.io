###### NN/g Usability Week • [Hoa Loranger] 

We can begin to know how our users think by first understanding how people behave. How do we explain behaviors we don't expect? Can we use behavioral patterns seen in the past to explain new behaviors and expand them to a broader audience? The truth is out there. If you takeaway just one thing, one memorable piece of information from this reading, let it be this:

> "A great designer understands human capabilities and limitations, and can anticipate 
> both of them. People will by nature create their own paths."

## Started From The Bottom Now We Here

We have to start somewhere! That somewhere is at the foundations of the different psychological schools of thought. We this foundation we can answer questions like: How do we take in, store, and use information? How do we use this information to affect our decision making? Usability is directly related to the behavioral, emotional, and biological levels of the human mind. 

There's an almost innate human tendency to believe that people around us will make the same decisions we might make. This is referred to as the False Consensus Effect, and it's one of the most fundamentally basic humanistic expressions that just can't help but rear it's self indulgent head 90% of the time. Yes, it's the tendency to assume that other people are just like you.

What makes us process and interpret information so differently? Humans tend to think that we make decisions on an individualistic level, but we often don't. The truth is that we are very heavily influenced by social norms.

        This effect is the tendency to focus or direct one's listening attention to only one person in the room, ignoring a full stack of other noises and conversations. Twitter and Facebook are the biggest Cocktail Parties of this generation.

## Skinnerian Cognitive Psychology

On the web, when people often have many different choices to choose from, they will often choose the path of least resistance. This is referred to as the Principle of Least Effort. Usability is based in the foundations of Cognitive Psychology. Personas, Behavioral Economics, Mental Models, Psychographics; these flashy terms that appear in the field of Usability and User Experience Design wouldn't have much meaning at all if not for the foundational basics of Cognitive Psychology.

    <h5>Helpful Tip</h5>
      Remember that we are complex beings. We feel, we sense, we gauge, and most importantly, we believe. We are much more complex than rats and dogs. (B.F. Skinner)
</div>

Inattentional Blindness, a human phenomenon that is more commonly known as, Selective Attention, states that we have a tendency to buffer ourselves from information overload via selective filtering. People have selective and limited cognitive resources. When bottle necking occurs, a person will tend to sort, choose, and use only the information that supports the task at hand. There are several theories of attention in cognitive psychology, all of them very relevant to understanding how our users think. Remember, a great designer understands human capabilities and limitations.

<h5>Cognitive Bottleneck Theory (CBT)</h5> 
  <article>
    Otherwise known as, cognitive distraction during multitasking, states that people have a limited amount of cognitive resources with which they tend to eliminate unattended information. These constraints allow us to effectively perform one task at a time. Studies have shown that during multitasking performance suffers as task completion is slowed due to a limiting "bottleneck", or constraint (Welford, A. T., 1967).

    Moral of the story: We're only humann
</div>


So, how can we design for all of these definitively human traits? We can limit the noise within the UI, also known as, KISS (keep it simple, silly). We can prioritize and categorize related information, otherwise known as, chunking. Think Gestaltian, consider the proximity of related information, create hierachy, communicate importance. Manage relationships between content like an author would do with the characters in a book. Are we arranging information and elements in a logical order for our users? Think about whether we are forcing the user to open content in new tabs or not. 

> "If the visual task is contrast, comparison, and choice – as so often, it
> is – then, the more relevant information within eyespan, the better"
> 
> – Edward Tufte, *Envisioning Informatoin p. 50*

How about the colors, shapes, and lines that are being placed into the user interface. Are they meaningful? Do they add value to the information being presented? Did you make it easier for the user to digest that information, or did you make it more difficult for them to process it? "Wait, so I now have to figure out why that button is green and this one here is blue? And why is there a line in between them? Which is the one I want to click?" 

<div class="tip">
<div class="separator"></div>
<h5>Helpful Tip!</h5> 
If what you're adding to the UI doesn't add communicative value, truly, you should eliminate it. Remember, every element requires processing.

## Goals, Context, Culture, and Prior Experience 

Goal related factors can affect atention. Using different parts of the brain to communicate to people through a screen. Biologically, we are not hjardwaired to multitask well, even gamers who claim they're amazing at it simply aren't. This is the reality of the human mind. Tasks are completed linearly, not in perallel on the web. It is safe to generalize, and research reports, that deep processing simply does not occur on the web. 


What's salient, depends on culture. Here's a *shocking* statistic of multitaking behind the wheel: 


> Twenty-seven percent of teens say they sometimes change clothes and shoes
> while driving, a study finds. They also reported that they often change
> contact lenses, put on makeup and do homework behind the wheel.
> 
> – [Teens Say They Change Clothes And Do Homework While Driving], via NPR


Tabs are used to organize, compartmentalize, and soprt and order. Think: browser tabs on the web, tasks are completed linearly, we are constantly switiching attention and focus, and for good reason. People apply tabs to create order, consider them "parking details". What can be parked for now and what might potentially disrupt the story we're telling? The downside to opening content in a new tab is that people are used to doing this themselves.

<div class="tip">

    <h5>Friendly Reminder</h5>
      People's perception is their reality, but things aren't always as they seem.
</div>

Context in presentation of content. The brain takes over to create perception in a meaningful way, even if it's completely at odds with reality. (Image reference: checkerboard graphic).

Web users are prone to contextual distractions. Consider context of use - in which situations are people using our systems? 

Previous experiences wholey affect perception. Practiced tasks become automatic. Requires proficiency, but even though resources are "freed up" for other tasks, mistakes are likely. Think about tapping "cancel" or "OK" in an alert view box - this is often an autopilot activity for the majority of mobile users.

### Meaning Is What We Make Of It

If we can't attach meaning to what we're seeing, then it's very difficult for us to understand it, or are apt not to try. An example of this would be a Japanese website to an American who's native language is English. Having such a busy website can define  reputation in this culture – the company will be judged as "doing well" and viewed as  either wealthy or prosperous. However, the cultural sentiments by no means infer that Japenese web users can multi-task more than native English web users can. Psychologically and biologically, they can't, we all have the same capabilities.

  <div class="separator separator-animated"></div>
    <h5>Helpful Tip!</h5>
      Perceiving an image is often a much quicker cognitive process than reading text. Why? A greater number of innate associations are evoked by both shapes and colors together. Remember to always design with perspective and context in mind.

    <h5>Top-Down Processing, Richard Gregory (1970)</h5>
      <article>
        Otherwise known as, conceptual-driven processing, states that our brains tend to make the best guesses based on prior experiences. It also illustrates the idea that our perceptions are highly influenced by our surrounding contexts. Our perceptions and ultimately, our interpretations (Rational Emotive Theory), are rooted in our expectations, past experiences, prior knowledge, and our beliefs.

### The Whole Is Other... ###

...than the sum of it's parts. This statement is drawn from Gestalt. The principles of Gestalt are hard wired into us, they've helped thinking and feeling species survive and evolve since the beginning of time. Help people see and understand relationships between information. Like, the relationship of objects. Placing related items closer together will likely increase conversion rates by 10%, that's how easy it is. You want the price tag to be hugging up right next to that big button that says "buy". Understand the priority and the information people need and then present it in a way that people expect and in which they can easily interpret. Think: hierarchy and importance when presenting information. Aesthetic is like appplying a "treatment", not just a "brand" – there's more to that word than we often think. Piggy backon prorotypical, learned behavioral patterns for all users, but harp on them when designing for acquisition. Be very careful when grouping content (slide 40). What is the cost–benefit? The value proposition? Lines are often disruptors – their essentially encourage people to just "stop". A familiar example might be with Google's Material Design in contrast to Apple's iOS 8 interface aesthetic - slim but line-heavy. Proximity of elements to each other can result in miscommunication.

### Visual Acuity and Perception and Interpretation.

Biological basis of behavior demonstrates that humans don't like to discriminate the fine details. Designing for the accomodation of the eye. Small fonts cause fatigue. Always consider size, color, contrast, and motion when designing for readability. Accomodation should be adjusted according to sesitivity and age of our users. There are ergonomics of usage to take into account. The stimulus is the target or the trigger that we want the user to interact with. It's been proven that even when users are given control over font sizing wihtin an interface, people would much rather complain about it than actually hit that button you've provided. 

There are two imporant reasons why this occurs: 

1. It takes effort to control and adjust, effort on the uesr's part. 
2. Well, you've just admitted that you did not design that experience for them. User's want to be taken into account, to be designed-for, to be thought of. "Aw, you designed this just for me? You shouldn't have. How did you know just how I like it?" Your users want to believe you designed that experience just for them. 

> "Hey, that text is much too big, it's annoying me" – Said Nobody 

7 to 10% of the population has a form of color blindness. This is why it's important that we only use color for emphasis when designing, and not a visual cue. If we are using color as a visual cue, it's best to use a supplement to it. For exampole, if the primary audience is primarily male, think about how red and green are utilized within the interface. 

### Innattention to Change and the Law of Proximity ###

#### Peripheral Vision Cannot Detect Fine Details

It's safe to be warry of putting calls to actions into what might might be your user's periphery.  Heat maps measure where people are focusing on the head-on view, not the peripheral view (yet). People tend to fixate on the meat of a page and avoid headers, titles, and aidebar content. Items in the periphery on a page can easily be overlooked. This is also referred to as, "change blindness". For better or for worse, people understand that advertisements are a necessary evil in the digital realm.

Design Tip: Explain user errors with behavioral principles before taking on a redesign. 

### The Importance of Conceptual Models

Mental models shape our behaviors and interpretations of real and imaginary experiences. Mental models are based in belief, not logic. They are formed by culture, experience, and context - we are not all the same person and we are not born knowing how to use everything. The first thing people  tend to do is apply their past experiences. 

#### Construct a Mental Model Flow Diagram

Schema: Restaurant
Script: Eating at a restaurant

In order to design for context appropriately, we need to first understand how people approach and prioritize a real-life process. Some designs build on existing mental models, like mimicking real-world interactions into the digital world. Layouts should always map back to exisitng mental models and behavioral patterns. 

### Memory, Attention, Interpretation, and Time on Task

LTM, which stands for long term memory is the type of information that is automatically retrieved as needed. STM, or short term memory, begins to decay after 20 seconds, and lasts up to a max of one minute. Sensory memory is by far the shortest lasting, at about 1 second. It's best to consider this type of information gathering a "snapshot", or active recall. Be careful to not unintentionally erase important information from the user's mind.

People use short term memory to make quick and rapid comparisons in order to help make a decision. The ability to use working or short term memory degrades over time and with age. 

An example of this would be a typical voicemail. Adding that little "thank you" or "have a nice day" right after reciting your phone number quickly and  erases the sensory memory of the phone number, the most important piece of content. Now your caller either has to recall you or just forgets about it. 

Rotating banner ads or carousels often seen on landing pages are great at erasing short term or iconic memory. What's happening is that content is being replaced with content, and when users are in task mode, as they often are, this results in the loss of communication from website to user.  

#### Best practices and easy solutions to design for working memory

1. Always apply visited link styles to your interface content. Take a google search results page as an example. It's safe to say most people depend on those purple links to guide where to click and not click next. 

2. Include labels inside of form fields as well as aligned above.

3. Present information that a user might be comparing on the same screen within the same view. Make it easy for the user to compare options. Decision processes become more cumbersome ultimately take longer to make when content comparisons are forced across multiple screens and views.

4. Tables can be nice short cuts to filtering information for the user.

5. Chunking information that we know a user might want ot relate will help the user recall particular concepts that will help in their decision making. 

Memory and Identification of Important Parts. Think Heiroglyphics. Take this example that illustrates the capacity of long term memory: When searching in Google, compare search engine web pages across the decades, back to the early 90's. They are all designed in the same way, with the same layout and exhibiting the same features. This is for a reason. Remember, we can design for efficiency, but we have to always consider a target audiences mental models. 

Conforming to users expectations means we have to first understand their prior experiences and adapt to them. Example to this is on (slide 92). For example, when you're filling out a form to puchase airline tickets, even if the airline website only needs a birth year, you are still asked for your month and day of borth. Why? Becasuse you and other users are already used to filling out all three of these pieces of information together. Breaking this unit up is often not worth the resulting unfamiliarity and uncecessary cognitive load.

#### Direct Manipulation

Remember, most often people expect to manipulate the user interface themselves. (slide 91). Consistency is just as important as context. Changing navigation structurescan become very sidorienting to users, especially across the same brands. Use both recognition and recall techniques to clue the user into what they need to remember in order to help them complete a task. You might have noticed that certain features in search engines like autocomplete and auto-suggest are completely necessary, use has become habit, users are more or less reliant upon such features today. A helpful cue in a search engine page or a directory or content listing page might be a recently viewed section of links or articles. Remember, memory i sshaped largely by our individual belief systems. 

Help people retrieve and acquire knowledge to use it to ocmplete a task or make a decision. Activatiuon is based on relationships of concept.  (draw triangle).

#### The Information Scent

Ask yourself about your designs: "Are we giving off strong information scent? Do our users know that they are right where they need to be?" Clear associative content that is labeles is able to be mentally connected. Help your user form bridges to cross, don't make them build their own. As difficult as it may be to hold back, don't be fancy, don't be cute, just be postiviely clear and lucid with the tasks at hand.

The degree to which we can correctly categorize content for user's to digest is correlated to information scent. Contextually appropriate triggers and stimuli.

### Comprehension and Reading

The most salient advice anyone could give a designer is to write well, or hire a technical writer who will write well. Writing is critical to comprehension. Technical writing expertise will provide invaluable strategery for your on-screen content. Remember, wrong clicks cost both the users and your Clients.

**The Stroop Effect**: Interference of conflicting information or sensory input. Make connections for people to help them comprehend and understand information. People are not generally detail oriented and are very strategic in expending energy. People are less methodicaland immersive when reading online than when reading in print. People rely on existing knowledge and prior experiences. Allow users to assimilate where new information can fit into already existingknowledge. Accommodation is an overwhelming task and decreases overall comprehension. We only have seconds from our users to get meaning across, we need to make content accessible and comprehensible. 

<div class="tip">
<h5>Helpful Tip: </h5>
Provide content section headers, headlines, and chunk out content as much as relevantly possible.
</div>

#### Writing For Different Audiences

Relying on heuristics to solve problems. Heuristics is also known as "the rule of thumb" or just plain old common sense.

<div class="tip">
<h5>Helpful Tip: </h5> 
Break content and experiences into goals and subgoals. Users love being guided through their own goals and subgoals. Proplr often prefer to have a decision made for them, especially online. This type of solution only works when you fully understand your target audiencer and the problem at hand.
</div>

### Progressive Disclosure

Progressively disclosing content that might be deemed horrible distractions if cued at the wrong times. Think: fashion sales representatives askinf to help you in a shopping experience - those who are great at it, spend only 10% of their time interacting with customers because the other 90% of their time is spent reading their customers' body language.

### Decision Making 

People like the perception of choice, to percieve that they are in control. But, when push comes to shove, they dont really want to do the work. Too many options can overwhelm people. After all, individuals care about different attributes. Multi-attribute decision making models tend to help with this. Take the example of searching online for apartments or a hotel. 

When you are designing a user interface, always remember to consider aspects from all perspectives. From the pragmatic side of design and from the attractive side of design. To be clear, these two perspectives do not respectively relate to usability and aesthetic; they treat both equally! 

<div class="tip">
<h5>Helpful Tip: </h5>
Never write "Fill this out in 3 easy steps!" Why? Because it's entirely subjective.
