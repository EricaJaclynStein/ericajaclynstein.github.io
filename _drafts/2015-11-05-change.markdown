Change is fucking frightening. It's everything and it's nothing. Change makes a live worth living, a dream worth having, and a fear worth putting up with. Oh how fortunate we are to experience a life. 

Everything is an excuse, what is there ever in this life to lose? You will inevitably lose everything; your job, your hair, your loved ones, your own life will eventually cease to exist, and then nothing is left. These lives are not here for morbid excuses, they are here to exist; kill the most sacred heart you will ever know and bury it long before your body is put into the ground, or choose to exist, choose to change. 

I think, therefore I change. I am this now, I was that before, and I eventually will be all the same yet something else entirely. Is that scary? Is it that, you cannot change *why* you are, but only *how* you are? What keeps your heart pounding at the end of the day, the week, the month, the year, the decade? 

In change, there is loss.
